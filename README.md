# TimelineMe
#

Tags: timelineme
Requires at least: 3.7.1
Tested up to: 3.9.1


Usable as a wordpress theme, future plans to turn it into a wp plugin that assumes your theme's styling. You don't have to download everything simply look for the theme titled: timelineme in wp-contents/themes. And add it to your wordpress installation.
## Description

TimelineMe was inspired by mainly by the importance of non-linear story telling as a way of presenting news in a more compelling and palatable manner. I looked at earlier work by The Knight Foundation, who have come up with a very useful plugin for non-linear story telling.

However, their wordpress plugin uses Google Docs to create the stories, which might not be as easy to use for some content producers. I was looking for a solution that allows content producers to create compelling content within a Content Management System. I opted for wordpress since it's a platform that we use in the Media House that i currently work for. In addition to that wordpress has got more than 60million websites and blogs which makes it one of the most popular platforms for content creation.

The key features of my project include: easy navigation, interactive content and sliders, mobile friendly views. The base code also has voice recognition and voice search, which i takes non-linear navigation to new levels. Note: voice search only works in Chrome 11 and later for now. Other browsers are yet to support it.


## Installation

1. Upload the theme to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory
1. Activate the theme through the 'Appearence > Themes' menu in WordPress
